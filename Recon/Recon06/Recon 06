This exercise covers default vhost

This challenge

For this challenge, your goal is to access the default virtual host ("vhost").
Fuzzing directories

When accessing a new webserver, it often pays off to replace the hostname with the IP address or to provide a random Host header in the request. To do this, you can either modify the request in a web proxy or use curl -H "Host: ....".

USED: curl -H "Host: X.X.X.X" http://hackycorp.com/
